          <h2>History of Villahermosa</h2>
          <p><em>by: Renz Ury Cordero</em></p>
          <p>
            Villahermosa is a barangay located in the province of Albay's
            municipality of Daraga. It is known as the boundary of Albay and
            Sorsogon district. Its population is consisting of 3,128 residents.
            According to elders, Villahermosa is known for its entertainment
            during the Marcos regime. It had a bowling alley and cinema for the
            people. The land is rich in crops, and large houses and buildings
            were constructed by a Marcos-type building back in the old days.

            Carabaos were commonly used as transportation of farmers and can be
            seen roaming around the road. The cows' manure is commonly seen by
            people. There were lots of trees along the road and a procession of
            elders and kids usually in the time of holy week. The people stop at
            the Our Lady of the Holy Rosary for the mass, and foods were
            distributed to people for free.
          </p>

            Villahermosa was recognized as the headquarters for the 901st
            infantry battalion and served as a training site for future police
            officers in the region. During the 1900s, the military regularly
            patrolled the area with tanks and infantry. According to an elder
            named "Encinares," she recalls witnessing a significant presence of
            armed forces and the enforcement of curfews during her childhood.
            She also stated that Villahermosa was almost considered as a
            municipal instead of Daraga, but the building operation was stopped
            as soon as Marcos was expelled from the presidency.
